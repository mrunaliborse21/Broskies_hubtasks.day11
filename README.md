Task 9: Build a Contact Book CLI App

Overview
For Task 9, we were required to build a command-line contact book application using Python. The objective was to create a simple yet functional application that allows users to store, search, and delete contact details.

What We Built
We built a basic contact book CLI app that includes the following features:

1. Add Contact: Allows users to add new contacts with name, phone number, and email.
2. Search Contact: Enables users to search for contacts by name or phone number.
3. Delete Contact: Allows users to delete existing contacts by name or phone number.
4. Display Contacts: Displays all stored contacts.

Why We Built It
The contact book CLI app was built to:

1. Practice CRUD Operations: By implementing create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations, we demonstrated our understanding of basic data manipulation techniques.
2. Utilize Python Data Structures: We used Python's built-in data structures, such as lists and dictionaries, to store and manage contact data.
3. Develop Command-Line Interface (CLI) Skills: Building a CLI app helped us develop skills in creating user-friendly command-line interfaces.

How We Built It
Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how we built the contact book CLI app:

Step 1: Designing the Application Structure
We decided to create a ContactBook class to encapsulate the contact book's data and operations. This class
